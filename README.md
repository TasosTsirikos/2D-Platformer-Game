This project is a 2D platformer game developed in Unity with C#, featuring a player navigating through a level filled with obstacles, moving platforms, spikes and AI-controlled enemies. The game includes mechanics such as descending through platforms, trampolines for high jumps, and an interactive end-goal system. Enemies have unique AI behaviors, including patrolling and projectile attacks, adding complexity to the gameplay. A failure tracking system counts player losses, stores them using PlayerPrefs, and displays them on the UI. The game also features a fully functional pause menu with options to restart, adjust difficulty settings, and resume gameplay. This project demonstrates fundamental Unity mechanics, AI behaviors, and UI integration.
